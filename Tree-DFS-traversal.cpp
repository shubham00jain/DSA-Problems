/*
A tree is a non-linear data structure. It is often termed as a "hierarchical or recursive data structure".
In graph thoery, A tree is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
It is made up of a user-defined class/ structure.
Most common tree is binary tree in which each node can have max 2 children.
The data members of a typical BT are:
1. data value
2. left child pointer 
3. right child pointer
Strict Binary tree - each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
Complete Binary tree- When making the level wise array(queue) of BT, there is no empty space in between.
Full Binary tree- A tree in which each node has 2 children, except the leaf nodes.

There are mainly 2 types of tree traversal.
1. DFS - going along the depth of the tree while following some common rule. Its general sub-types are: Pre-order(Root,L,R), In-order(L,Root,Right), Post-order(Left,Right,Root).
2. BFS - going along the breath of the tree while following some common rule.
