# In this we only have to define the enque and deque operations.

## For enque:
### 1. Initilize 2 stacks.
### 2. Check if Stack 1 is not full and push inside it.

## For deenque:
### 1. Check if stack 2 is empty or not. If it is not empty pop the top element and return it.
### 2. If Stack 2 is empty then pop the whole stack s1 into s2. And then return s2.top().
### 3. If if Stack S1 is empty then return Error.
