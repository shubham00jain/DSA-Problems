* ### Every Acyclic Graph is a tree.

* ### Degree Sum formula:
  Sum of all the degrees of a graph is twice the number of edges in the graph.

* ### Handshake lemma:
  In every finite undirected graph an even number of vertices will always have odd degree. This can easily be proved by degree sum formula.

* ### Articulate Vertex or Cut Vertex:
  A vertex is called ariculate vertex iff by removing or cutting that vertex disconnects the graph and makes one more component in the graph.

* ### Connected Components:
  If a graph has nodes which are not connected to each other, all of those nodes are called components of the graph.
  If a graph has 2 components which are not connected by any edge but has many conncted nodes inside them, then those components are called connected components.
  The minimum number of edges in a graph having k connected components is n-k
