* ### Every Acyclic Graph is a tree.

* ### Degree Sum formula:
  Sum of all the degrees of a graph is twice the number of edges in the graph.

* ### Handshake lemma:
  In every finite undirected graph an even number of vertices will always have odd degree. This can easily be proved by degree sum formula.

* ### Articulate Vertex or Cut Vertex:
  A vertex is called ariculate vertex iff by removing or cutting that vertex disconnects the graph and makes one more component in the graph.
